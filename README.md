## Instructions
Tkinter should come by default with python3.
Test from terminal: python -m tkinter
A simple window should appear. If you receive a "Tk not configured" error, Tk may need to be installed.
Although I am using Manjaro, here is a list of commands used for other distros\

**pacman**: sudo pacman -S tk\
**apt**: sudo apt install python3-tk\
**dnf**: dnf install python3-tkinter\
**yum**: yum install tkinter tk-devel

---
You may need to install 2 more libraries: 
1) First install PIP by typing **sudo pacman -S python-pip** 
	* Requests - API handler
	* Pillow - The python imaging library
2) Run the command in terminal\  
**pip install reqeusts**\
**sudo pacman -S python-imaging**\
3) Sign-up to: OpenWeatherMap.org it's FREE!!
	* Copy the FREE api key and continue.
